        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            Welcome to Loaded & Locked In Training Academy LLC. By accessing our website and using our services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4 text-primary-red">1. Course Enrollment and Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Enrollment in any course (including Maryland HQL, CCW, and Advanced Training) requires the client to accurately represent their **legal eligibility to possess and handle firearms** as dictated by federal, state, and local law, including the State of Maryland.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary-red">2. Safety and Conduct</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Safety is non-negotiable. All clients must adhere strictly to the **4 universal rules of firearm safety** during all training sessions. Failure to comply may result in immediate dismissal from the course without refund. Clients must follow all instructions given by the Certified Instructor or Range Safety Officer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary-red">3. Certification and Licensure</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Completion of a course does not guarantee certification or licensure by any governmental agency. Loaded & Locked In Training Academy LLC provides the required training curriculum, but final issuance of permits and licenses rests solely with the respective government authority.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary-red">4. Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            **Cancellation by Client:** Cancellations made 7 days or more before the scheduled course date will receive a full refund minus a $50 administrative fee. Cancellations made less than 7 days in advance are non-refundable.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            **No-Show Policy:** Clients who fail to appear for a scheduled course without prior notice will forfeit the entire course fee.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            **Rescheduling:** Clients may reschedule a course one time at no charge if done 48 hours in advance. Additional rescheduling requests may incur a $25 fee.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary-red">5. Assumption of Risk</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Client acknowledges that participation in firearm training involves inherent risks, including the risk of serious physical injury or death. By enrolling, the Client voluntarily assumes all risks associated with the use and handling of firearms and training equipment.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-10 mb-4 text-sm">
